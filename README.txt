PoCamon Instructions

To run PoCamon, enter the following command into terminal:
sh run.sh

Alternatively, you may compile and run the game yourself by:
cs3110 compile -p str game.ml
cs3110 run game.ml

How To Play

To play the game, resize your window, select if you want to play
a human or against the AI (Rival). The AI will start a series of battles
against the Elite 7 CS Professors.

The game has tab completion and takes into account aspects of the original
pokemon including super effectivenes, status effects, pocamon stats charging
moves, and many more.

On any turn, you can use your current pocamon's move by going into Fight
and using the move. Alternatively, you can switch pocamon by going into
PoCamon and switching pocamon. You can also check your Bag at any time
to see if there's anything in there or try to Run.
